# Pyrogram JSON Dump

Simple Telegram bot that just dumps the JSON of a message.

You can append `-r` to a message to get the raw output of a message.
If something reaches the maximum message length (4096 characters), it'll automatically cast the output to a file and send that instead.

Self-hosting should be self explanatory.
